# Prototype
* A partially or fully init object you copy(clone) and make use of. 

## Motivation
* Complicated objects (e.g cars) are not design from stratch
	* They reiterate existing designs
* An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype
* We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
	* Requires 'deep copy' support
* We make the cloning convient (i.e via Factories)
