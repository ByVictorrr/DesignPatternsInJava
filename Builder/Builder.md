# Builder 

## Motivation
	* Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call
	* Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
	* Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
	* Instead, opt for piecewise contruction
	* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

### Examples
	* StringBuilder - maybe want to build a string
