# Summary for Design Principles

## Single Responsible Principle
	* A class should only have one reason to change
	* Separation of concerns - diff classes handle diff, independent
	task/problems
## Open-Closed Principle
	* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov-Substition Principle 
	* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface-Segregation Principle
	* Dont put to much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
	* YAGNI - you aint going to need it

## Dependency Inversion Principle 
	* High-Level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use
	abstractions(interfaces)
